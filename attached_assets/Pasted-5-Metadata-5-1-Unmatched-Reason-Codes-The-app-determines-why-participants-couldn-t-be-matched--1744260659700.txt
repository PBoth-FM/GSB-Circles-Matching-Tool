5. Metadata

5.1 Unmatched Reason Codes
The app determines why participants couldn't be matched. Create a new variable unmatched_reason. Example values include “No preferences”, “No location preference”, etc. Determine the assigned value based on the following order:
No preferences: If the participant didn't provide any location or time preferences
No location preference: Provided a time preference but no location preference
No time preference: Provided a location but no time
Location issues: If none of their location preferences match existing circles or have enough similar participants to form a new circle
Time compatibility: If their time preferences don't match with locations where they could be placed
No host available: For in-person circles, if there aren't enough potential hosts
Optimization trade-off: If the participant was excluded due to optimization constraints
Other: if none of the above apply

5.2 Circle Properties
Each circle maintains the following metadata:
Identification:
circle_id: Unique identifier following naming convention
format: "In-person" or "Virtual"
region: Physical location or time zone (e.g., “South Florida” or “GMT-5”)
subregion: For in-person circles, this is a more specific physical location (e.g., "Miami")
Meeting Details:
proposed_NEW_Subregion: Subregion of new assigned circle (e.g., “Miami”)
proposed_NEW_DayTime: Day and time specification (e.g., "Monday (Evenings)")
proposed_NEW_CircleHosts: List of encoded IDs for all hosts in the new circle
proposed_NEW_CircleLeaders: List of encoded IDs for all co-leaders in the new circle
Proposed_NEW_Circle_Format: Format of new circle ("In-person" or "Virtual")
Membership:
members: List of participant objects assigned to the circle
member_count: Integer count of members
new_members: Count of newly added members
continuing_members: Count of continuing members
Analysis Data:
industry_distribution: Distribution of members' industries
## add demographic data later
host_capacity: Count of members where host is “Always” or “Sometimes”

5.3 Output CSV additional data
For each participant, create the following fields:
proposed_NEW_circles_id: Assigned circle ID or "UNMATCHED" status
unmatched_reason: For unmatched participants, explains why they couldn't be matched
host: Participant's hosting ability ("Always", "Sometimes", “Never Host” , “n/a” or blank)
proposed_NEW_host: Whether participant is assigned as host ("Yes" or "No")
proposed_NEW_co_leader: Whether participant is assigned as co-leader ("Yes" or "No")

Appendices
Appendix 1: Subregion normalization
This table ties all current variations of Subregion to a normalized list. There may in the future be additional subregion variations. Please apply standard normalization (white spaces, capitalization, use of / vs -) as needed.
