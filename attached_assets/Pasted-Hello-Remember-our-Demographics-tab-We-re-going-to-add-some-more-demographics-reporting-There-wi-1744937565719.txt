Hello! Remember our Demographics tab? We're going to add some more demographics reporting.  There will be a total of 5 demographics categories:
Class Vintage - This is already done (good job!)
Employment
Industry
Racial Identity
Children

For now, let's start with Employment.

Employment:
Use the column from the input file "Employment Status". Note that there can be multiple values in this column. Create a new column "Employment Category" that consolidates the statuses as follows:
- "Employed full-time for wages": use this if Employment Status contains "Employed full-time for wages". E.g., if the cell value is "Employed full-time for wages,Full-time parent or caregiver,Looking for work", Employment Category is "Employed full-time for wages"
- "Self-employed": Use this if Employment Status contains "Self-Employed" or "Self-employed" and does NOT contain "Employed full-time for wages". So, if Employment status is "Employed part-time for wages,Self-employed,Full-time parent or caregiver,Looking for work" then categorize as "Self-employed". If Employment Status is "Employed full-time for wages,Self-employed,Full-time parent or caregiver" then categorize as "Employed full-time for wages"
- "Other": All other Employment Statuses.

Make a tab within Demographics, to the right of Class Vintage, which shows:
- Employment Diversity Within Circles: Histogram of the distribution of circles by number of categories of Employment. Since there are three categories of Employment, there are bars for 1, 2 and 3. The height is the count of circles that have that many categories among their participants.
- Employment Diversity Score: For each circle, calculate an "Employment diversity score": 1 point if everyone is in the same Employment Category. 2 points if two Employment Catgories.3 points if three Employment Categories.
- Distribution of Employment: Histogram showing total # of participants in each Employment Category. 
- At the top of the Tab, like with Class Vintage, include ability to Filter by Region and Filter by Match Status
